# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Name: Messaging App 
Description
This project is a simple web application that allows users to:

Log in and log out securely.

Send and receive messages to/from other users in real time.

The application leverages modern web development technologies and follows best practices for user authentication and state management.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login and logout functionality using state management tools (e.g., Redux).

Messaging System: Allows authenticated users to send and receive messages.

Dynamic User Interface: Real-time updates for messages and user status.

Error Handling: Proper error handling for invalid credentials, message failures, and unauthorized access.

Technologies Used
Frontend
React.js: For building the user interface.

Redux Toolkit: For state management.

CSS: For styling components.

Backend
Node.js: For the server-side logic.

Express.js: For handling API requests.

Database
MongoDB: For storing user information and messages.

Additional Tools
Postman: For testing API endpoints.

WebSockets: For real-time communication.

API Endpoints
Authentication
POST /api/auth/login: Authenticate a user and return a token.

POST /api/auth/logout: Log out the user and clear the session.

Messages
GET /api/messages: Retrieve all messages for the authenticated user.

POST /api/messages: Send a new message to another user.

State Management
The app uses Redux Toolkit to manage the following states:

authUser: Stores information about the currently logged-in user.

otherUsers: Stores the list of other users available for messaging.

messages: Stores the messages exchanged with other users.
